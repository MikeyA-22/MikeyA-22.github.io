## Description

I created a Pomodoro timer to help users manage their time more effectively and boost productivity. The Pomodoro technique involves working for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break, which helps maintain focus and prevent burnout.

## Features
<b>Core Features</b>: The timer includes customizable work and break intervals, notifications, and a simple user interface.

<b>Unique Features</b>: 
* The use of multithreading and the finite state machine design pattern to allow the user to easily look at other timer features without losing the current time being used.
* The ability to customize the length of each period of time you choose.

## Tools and Platforms: 
* Git for version control
* Pycharm for programming in python

## Development Process

<b>Planning</b>: I started with some mind mapping in miro and user stories to outline the main features and user flow.
I gathered reference videos and material from sites like Youtube and Wikipedia.

<b>Implementation</b>: The biggest challenge was getting the multi-threading to work properly and getting arranging the UI in the manner that I wanted

<b>Testing</b>: I conducted thorough testing to ensure the timer works correctly and notifications are triggered at the right times.

<b>Conclusion</b>:
This project taught me a lot about state management and the importance of planning before diving into coding. In the future, I plan to add more customization options and integrate the timer with other productivity tools.
