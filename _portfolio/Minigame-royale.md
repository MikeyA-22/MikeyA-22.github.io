## Game Overview

Minigame Royale is a collection of simplistic arcade-type minigames where players compete against each other to see who can win more games of their choosing. Players can select from a variety of games, including top-down games, side-view games, shooter games, dodging games, and more!
As the sole artist for Minigame Royale, I played a pivotal role in bringing the game’s world to life.

# Breakdown of each minigame
* **Danger Dodgeball**: In this game the player tries to hit the other player with a dodgeball, the ball's color indicates which player would lose a life for hitting the player
* **Ricochet Rumble**: This game features the player attempting to shoot the other player with a ricocheting bullet to take their lives, though hitting yourself takes life as well!
* **Pivot Panic**: The players try to bat themselves off the pivoting platforms, while avoiding cannon fire! be careful as you falling into the lava below takes a life!
* **Bullet Buttons**: The players must click buttons to turn it to their colors, and cause bullets to fire at the other players!
* **Trail Trapper**: A tron or snake inspired experience, the game features players driving around, but if you hit the other player's trail, you lose a life!
* **Savage Shooter**: Players must avoid getting hit by bullets shot by the opposing player by going from height to height, but be wary! the bullets will follow you regardless of the level you are at!

## Character Design 
The game characters were designed with only the colors red and blue to make it simple for the player to differentiate between while giving the game a fun and vibrant design

## Tutorialization

the tutorialization for the game features a simple screen before each game that shows off the game's core mechanic and controls, using the colors to differentiate the player's controls.

## UI/UX Design
I designed the user interface and user experience, making the game intuitive and easy to navigate. My attention to detail ensures that players can focus on the fun without any distractions.

## Minigame Design
I also contributed to the design of each mini-game, collaborating with the team to create engaging and challenging gameplay mechanics.
My artistic vision and dedication have significantly contributed to the game’s success, making it a visually stunning and enjoyable experience for players.

## Sprites and Animations
I meticulously crafted the sprites and animations,keeping in mind the limitations of being the only artist I made sure the animations were simple and transferable between each mini-game, ensuring smooth and visually appealing movements that enhance the overall gaming experience.
