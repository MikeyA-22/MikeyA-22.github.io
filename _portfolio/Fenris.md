An isometric hack and slash action-adventure game where the player must traverse a frozen wasteland and defeat various types of enemies.

## Research and Development

The original Idea for the game was a game the Five stages of grief, with each area relating to a stage and having its own unique theme, unique enemies and unique bosses. But we overestimated how much time we would have for this and decided to shorten it to the first are denial, which featured a snowy terrain.

This change in direction prompted us to change and improve the characters and to rename the game **Fenris**.
I also had the responsibility of helping create the mood for the game, using various lighting techniques, and level design to create the mood of the game, allowing the game to feel both quiet and empty, but still avoid looking monotone.

The character designs I created where also adjusted to fit in with this theme, the sword the character uses features norse runes, which translate to wolf, the characters also wore clothing which took inspiration from norse backgrounds.

# Playtesting

Through playtests conducted by myself and the team, we were able to get feedback that helped improve the overall gameplay

The game originally did not feature the text cues after the sword pickup, and during the playtesting we were able to hear from playtesters that there was some confusion about the right direction to go in after collecting the sword. We used this to help improve the gameplay by prompting the player to go in the right direction after collecting the sword.

The game was also significantly more difficult than its final iteration, but through the player feedback, we were able to determine and improve the gameplay. 



## Gameplay and Level Design

The gameplay and level design of Fenris emphasizes exploration, progression, and environmental puzzles inspired by games like The Legend of Zelda, Deathâ€™s Door, and Tunic. It features a large, snowy environment where players face various enemies with unique strengths and weaknesses. 

Key mechanics include:

* Hack and slash combat mechanics: The player can attack with a sword shoot a long range ice shot, and roll to dynamically dodge attacks.s
* Puzzle Integration: Using an ice shot to create bridges and a sword to clear debris, enhancing exploration and navigation.
* Linear Progression: Levels guide players toward a final boss while encouraging exploration through subtle environmental cues.
* Thematic Design: The snowy setting reflects the "Denial" stage of grief, integrating narrative and design seamlessly.

This thoughtful level design balances challenge, story integration, and player engagement.

## Tutorialization

To save time on tutorialization, the game uses text based cues to direct the player in the right direction and to give them a way to easily overcome challenges they may not be fully aware of yet.


## UI and Poster Art

I created the poster and background art, and helped ideate the UI used in the game.

The UI features a simple text displayed when the player needs information, for example, when the player has a healing orb in their range.

## Asset Modelling(Environment And Character Art)

As the lead (and only) artist on the team, I was tasked with creating virtually all the 3D assets in the game, including the characters and environmental assets.

## Rigging and Animation

I rigged and animated all the characters in the Game.

All the animations were done by me personally with blender and cascadeur. I used cascadeur to help block out more complex animations, such as the skeleton enemies walk
Majority of the characters were rigged with Mixamo, but for special cases where Mixamo could not match the proportions, like the rock monster and the wolf, I had rigged personally.

## VFX and Shaders

I created some of the VFX and shaders used in the game including:

* The water depth, which had to be adjusted for the isometric view, so depth could still be seen in the water.
* The slash vfx
* The dappled lighting, made using cloud cookies, as seen in games like Tunic and Death's door
